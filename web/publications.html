 A modular memory optimization for synchronous data-flow languages.
 In <em>Proc. of the ACM International Conference on Languages,
  Compilers, Tools and Theory for Embedded Systems (LCTES'12)</em>, Beijing, China,
  June 2012.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
The generation of efficient sequential code for
                  synchronous data-flow languages raises two
                  intertwined issues: control and memory
                  optimization. While the former has been extensively
                  studied, for instance in the compilation of LUSTRE
                  and SIGNAL, the latter has only been addressed in a
                  restricted manner. Yet, memory optimization becomes
                  a pressing issue when arrays are added to such
                  languages.  This article presents a two-level
                  solution to the memory optimization problem. It
                  combines a compile-time optimization algorithm,
                  reminiscent of register allocation, paired with
                  language annotations on the source given by the
                  designer. Annotations express in-place modifications
                  and control where allocation is performed. Moreover,
                  they allow external functions performing in-place
                  modifications to be safely imported. Soundness of
                  annotations is guaranteed by a semilinear type
                  system and additional scheduling constraints. A key
                  feature is that annotations for well-typed programs
                  do not change the semantics of the language:
                  removing them may lead to less efficient code but
                  will not alter the semantics.  The method has been
                  implemented in a new compiler for a LUSTRE-like
                  synchronous language extended with hierarchical
                  automata and arrays. Experiments show that the
                  proposed approach removes most of the unnecessary
                  array copies, resulting in faster code that uses
                  less memory.

We present a novel technique for designing discrete,

                  tasks sequencings and mode changes.  We define this
                  new handler on top of the real-time executives built
                  with the Orccad design environment for control
                  systems, which is applied, e.g. to robotics and
                  real-time networked control.  It features structures
                  of control tasks, each equipped with a local
                  automaton, used for the reactive, event-based
                  management of its activity and modes.  The
                  additional discrete handler manages the interactions
                  between tasks, concerning, e.g., mutual exclusions,
                  forbidden or imposed sequences.  We use a new
                  reactive programming language, with constructs for
                  finite-state machines and data-flow nodes, and a
                  mechanism of behavioral contracts, which involves
                  discrete controller synthesis.  The result is a
                  discrete control loop, on top of the continuous
                  control loops, all integrated in a coherent
                  real-time architecture.  Our approach is illustrated

 Synchronous control of reconfiguration in fractal component-based

<blockquote><font size="-1">
In the context of component-based embedded systems,
                  the management of dynamic reconfiguration in
                  adaptive systems is an increasingly important
                  feature. The Fractal component-based framework, and
                  its industrial instantiation MIND, provide for
                  support for control operations in the lifecycle of
                  components. Nevertheless, the use of complex and
                  integrated architectures make the management of this
                  reconfiguration operations difficult to handle by
                  programmers. To address this issue, we propose to
                  use Synchronous languages, which are a complete
                  approach to the design of reactive systems, based on
                  behavior models in the form of transition
                  systems. Furthermore, the design of closed-loop
                  reactive managers of reconfigurations can benefit
                  from formal tools like Discrete Controller
                  Synthesis. In this paper we describe an approach to
                  concretely integrate synchronous reconfiguration
                  managers in Fractal component-based systems. We
                  describe how to model the state space of the control
                  problem, and how to specify the control
                  objectives. We describe the implementation of the
                  resulting manager with the Fractal/Cecilia
                  programming environment, taking advantage of the
                  Comete distributed middleware. We illustrate and
                  validate it with the case study of the Comanche HTTP
                  server on a multi-core execution platform.

Green computing is nowadays a major challenge for
                  most IT organizations.  Administrators have to
                  manage the trade-off between system performances and
                  energy saving goals. Autonomic computing is a
                  promising approach to control the QoS and the energy
                  consumed by a system.  This paper precisely
                  investigates the use of synchronous programming and
                  discrete controller synthesis to automate the
                  generation of a controller that enforces the
                  required coordination between QoS and energy
                  managers.  We illustrate our approach by describing
                  the coordination between a simple admission
                  controller and an energy controller.

We describe the extension of a reactive programming
                  language with a behavioral contract construct.  It
                  is dedicated to the programming of reactive control
                  of applications in embedded systems, and involves
                  principles of the supervisory control of discrete
                  event systems.  Our contribution is in a language
                  approach where modular discrete controller synthesis
                  (DCS) is integrated, and it is concretized in the
                  encapsulation of DCS into a compilation process.
                  From transition system specifications of possible
                  behaviors, DCS automatically produces controllers
                  that make the controlled system satisfy the property
                  given as objective.  Our language features and
                  compiling technique provide
                  correctness-by-construction in that sense, and
                  enhance reliability and verifiability.  Our
                  application domain is adaptive and reconfigurable
                  systems: closed-loop adaptation mechanisms enable
                  flexible execution of functionalities w.r.t.
                  changing resource and environment conditions.  Our
                  language can serve programming such adaption
                  controllers.  This paper particularly describes the
                  compilation of the language.  We present a method
                  for the modular application of discrete controller
                  synthesis on synchronous programs, and its
                  integration in the BZR language.  We consider
                  structured programs, as a composition of nodes, and
                  first apply DCS on particular nodes of the program,
                  in order to reduce the complexity of the controller
                  computation; then, we allow the abstraction of parts
                  of the program for this computation; and finally, we
                  show how to recompose the different controllers
                  computed from different abstractions for their
                  correct co-execution with the initial program.  Our
                  work is illustrated with examples, and we present
                  quantitative results about its implementation.

                  while being encapsulated in a tool that makes it
                  useable by application experts. Our approach is
                  based on the synchronous modelling techniques,
                  languages and tools.
